# Technology Stack

- **Python Version:** Python 3.10+ (aligns with RAGFlow's support for modern Python versions).
- **Dependency Management:** Poetry / Rye (RAGFlow uses `uv` for dependency management, but Poetry/Rye are compatible and widely adopted).
- **Code Formatting:** Ruff (replaces `black`, `isort`, `flake8`) – consistent with modern Python standards.
- **Type Hinting:** Strictly use the `typing` module. All functions, methods, and class members must have type annotations.
- **Testing Framework:** `pytest` (RAGFlow's testing suite can leverage this).
- **Documentation:** Google-style docstrings (aligns with RAGFlow's open-source readability goals).
- **Environment Management:** `conda` / `venv` (RAGFlow supports Docker, but local dev benefits from these).
- **Containerization:** `docker`, `docker-compose` (core to RAGFlow's deployment strategy).
- **Asynchronous Programming:** Prefer `async` and `await` (used in RAGFlow's API and service interactions).
- **Web Framework:** `fastapi` (RAGFlow uses HTTP APIs; FastAPI is a natural fit).
- **Demo Framework:** `gradio`, `streamlit` (useful for RAGFlow demos and community contributions).
- **LLM Framework:** `langchain`, `transformers` (essential for RAGFlow's LLM integration).
- **Vector Database:** `elasticsearch` (RAGFlow's default recall engine) + optional `faiss`, `chroma`.
- **Experiment Tracking:** `mlflow`, `tensorboard` (optional, supports RAGFlow's ML experimentation).
- **Hyperparameter Optimization:** `optuna`, `hyperopt` (optional, for tuning RAGFlow's models).
- **Data Processing:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `dask` (optional), `pyspark` (optional) – for handling document data.
- **Version Control:** `git` (RAGFlow is hosted on GitHub).
- **Server:** `gunicorn`, `uvicorn` (with `nginx` or `caddy`) – aligns with RAGFlow's deployment.
- **Process Management:** `systemd`, `supervisor` (used in RAGFlow's Docker setup).

# Coding Guidelines

## 1. Pythonic Practices

- **Elegance and Readability:** Strive for elegant and Pythonic code that is easy to understand and maintain, especially for RAGFlow's diverse open-source contributors.
- **PEP 8 Compliance:** Adhere to PEP 8 guidelines, enforced via Ruff, to ensure consistency with RAGFlow's codebase.
- **Explicit over Implicit:** Favor explicit code to enhance clarity for RAGFlow's community and enterprise users.
- **Zen of Python:** Apply Zen principles to balance simplicity and functionality in RAGFlow's complex document-processing tasks.

## 2. Modular Design

- **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each module/file should focus on a single aspect of RAGFlow (e.g., document parsing, retrieval, LLM integration).
- **Reusable Components:** Develop reusable functions and classes (e.g., chunking utilities, OCR helpers) to support RAGFlow's extensibility.
- **Package Structure:** Organize code into logical packages (e.g., `ragflow.parsing`, `ragflow.retrieval`) mirroring RAGFlow's architecture.

## 3. Code Quality

- **Comprehensive Type Annotations:** Enforce type annotations to improve RAGFlow's maintainability and catch errors early in its complex workflows.
- **Detailed Docstrings:** Use Google-style docstrings to document RAGFlow's APIs, parsing logic, and LLM interactions, aiding community adoption.
- **Thorough Unit Testing:** Target 90%+ test coverage with `pytest`, focusing on RAGFlow's document parsing, retrieval, and response generation.
- **Robust Exception Handling:** Handle specific exceptions (e.g., OCR failures, Elasticsearch timeouts) with clear messages, enhancing RAGFlow's reliability.
- **Logging:** Use `logging` to track RAGFlow's document processing, API calls, and errors for debugging and monitoring.

## 4. ML/AI Specific Guidelines

- **Experiment Configuration:** Use `yaml` (RAGFlow's preference) for configuring document parsing and LLM settings reproducibly.
- **Data Pipeline Management:** Leverage scripts or `dvc` to manage RAGFlow's document preprocessing pipeline (e.g., PDF parsing, table recognition).
- **Model Versioning:** Use `git-lfs` or MinIO (RAGFlow's storage) to version OCR and embedding models.
- **Experiment Logging:** Log RAGFlow experiments (e.g., retrieval accuracy, response time) with `mlflow` or custom logs.
- **LLM Prompt Engineering:** Maintain a `prompts/` module for RAGFlow's LLM templates, versioned with `git`.
- **Context Handling:** Implement efficient context management (e.g., using `collections.deque`) for RAGFlow's multi-turn dialogues.

## 5. Performance Optimization

- **Asynchronous Programming:** Use `async`/`await` for RAGFlow's I/O-bound tasks (e.g., file uploads, Elasticsearch queries).
- **Caching:** Apply `functools.lru_cache` or FastAPI caching for repeated RAGFlow queries or embeddings.
- **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor RAGFlow's Docker services (e.g., Elasticsearch, MinIO) with `psutil`.
- **Memory Efficiency:** Ensure RAGFlow releases resources after document processing to avoid leaks.
- **Concurrency:** Use `asyncio` for concurrent document parsing and retrieval in RAGFlow.
- **Database Best Practices:** Optimize Elasticsearch queries and indexing for RAGFlow's recall performance.

## 6. API Development with FastAPI

- **Data Validation:** Use Pydantic models for RAGFlow's HTTP API inputs (e.g., document uploads, query requests).
- **Dependency Injection:** Leverage FastAPI's dependency injection for RAGFlow's services (e.g., LLM clients, Elasticsearch).
- **Routing:** Define RESTful routes (e.g., `/v1/document`, `/v1/query`) consistent with RAGFlow's API design.
- **Background Tasks:** Use FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` for RAGFlow's asynchronous document processing.
- **Security:** Implement OAuth 2.0/JWT for RAGFlow's API, aligning with enterprise needs.
- **Documentation:** Auto-generate OpenAPI docs for RAGFlow's HTTP APIs.
- **Versioning:** Support API versioning (e.g., `/v1/`) to maintain RAGFlow's compatibility.
- **CORS:** Configure CORS for RAGFlow's web UI and external integrations.

# Code Example Requirements

- All functions must include type annotations.
- Provide clear, Google-style docstrings.
- Annotate key logic with comments.
- Include usage examples (e.g., in `tests/` or `__main__` sections) relevant to RAGFlow (e.g., parsing a PDF).
- Implement error handling for RAGFlow-specific cases (e.g., file format errors).
- Use `ruff` for formatting.

# Others

- **Prioritize Python 3.10+ features** (e.g., structural pattern matching) to align with RAGFlow's modern codebase.
- **Explain code logically** with comments, focusing on RAGFlow's document understanding and retrieval logic.
- **Justify suggestions** with trade-offs (e.g., Elasticsearch vs. vector DBs for RAGFlow's recall).
- **Indicate file names** for multi-file examples (e.g., `ragflow/parsing/pdf.py`).
- **Keep solutions simple** yet efficient, avoiding over-engineering RAGFlow's core functionality.
- **Balance modularity** with RAGFlow's need for cohesive document-processing workflows.
- **Use modern libraries** (e.g., `transformers` for embeddings) when they enhance RAGFlow's capabilities, justifying their inclusion.
- **Ensure examples are executable** within RAGFlow's Docker environment or a minimal setup.
- **Ask clarifying questions** if a RAGFlow-related request is ambiguous (e.g., specific document types).
- **Secure code** for RAGFlow's user-uploaded documents and API inputs.
- **Promote RAGFlow best practices** (e.g., deep document understanding, explainable retrieval).
